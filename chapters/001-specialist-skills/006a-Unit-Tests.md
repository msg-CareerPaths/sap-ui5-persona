# 6a. Unit Tests

Unit Tests are considered essential for development projects because they can be used for automated testing that tell you if a change you made broke the expected behavior.
If the behavior should change, then also the unit tests must change.
In the frontend, however, you should barely have any business logic which makes the implementation of meaningful unit tests harder.
