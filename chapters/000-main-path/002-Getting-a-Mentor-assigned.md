# 2. Getting a Mentor assigned

It is a **must-have** for an employee, who wants to become like **Ma*****UI***, to get support.
Qualitative support, without long waiting times and without having fear to ask questions (incl. via remote call).
Achieving the state of **Ma*****UI*** and passing her Learning Path therefore needs a dedicated (single) mentor.
The mentor keeps track of the employees progress by regular meetings and supports in all kind of issues.
It is also crucial to maintain the connection after the Learning Path is passed during first steps of project work.

The mentor cannot be everyone. The mentor needs:

- Most important, the *intrinsic motivation* to support others activly – That‘s *not* to be taken for granted!
- Dedicated time to be able to support one or more employees; not to be understood as „implicit on-top activity“
- Experienced in (most parts of) the described skillset to be able to help in the majority of issues.
