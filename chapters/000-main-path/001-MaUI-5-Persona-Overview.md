![MaUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msg-CareerPaths/sap-ui5-persona/main/assets/MaUI.png)

Ma*UI* is new to the SAP world and very interessted in Front-End development. He wants to focus on the modern parts of SAP UI Development and is eager to become a demigod in web development and create pleasing web applications for business users.

## What is Ma*UI* capable of?

When Ma*UI* has finished the first three major steps of the given Learning Path, he is able to get staffed in upcoming development projects (customer or product). He already has basic knowledge in all of the needed skills and is looking forward to get project experience in order to deepen his knowledge. This is important as he has no real “expert knowledge yet” and the topic is very complex – therefore it is a must-have to also have an experienced lead developer in the project, which helps him taking the first steps in “real life”.

## Why does msg need more Ma*UI*‘s?

For msg, it is important to have many developers like Ma*UI*. As UI5/Fiori is the strategic UI technology of SAP, projects will increasingly (and already are) need UI5 developers.
In addition, most basic skills are also needed for CAP development.

## Why do you want to be like Ma*UI*?

UI5 will become ever more important and so will you, if you have the skills.
Additionally, it makes the entry into CAP development (another cutting edge topic) way easier.
Also, you will get used to web development as such from the “protected” area of SAP, which makes it easier to expand to non-SAP web application development frameworks/libraries.
OpenUI5 is open source and free to use, so you can use it on any non-SAP project, private or otherwise, as well.
